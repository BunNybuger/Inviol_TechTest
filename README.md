## Head detector and Blurring

This repository contains code for a head detector and blurring tool. Follow the steps below to use it:

1. Ensure you have the `requirements.txt` file. If not, you can install the required dependencies by running:

pip install -r requirements.txt


2. Open the `Head_detector.ipynb` notebook and provide the path of your dataset as `input_path`

3. Run the remaining code cells in the notebook. and Check the `output_path` for blurred images and text files.

If you prefer blurring the heads instead of using a black box, you can modify the code on line 81 by setting the `blur` to `True`.

Happy detecting and blurring!
